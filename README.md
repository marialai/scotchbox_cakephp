# Scotch/Box with CakePHP

Run `vagrant up` to install a Scotch/Box with CakePHP, including a modified `app.php` to reflect default Scotch/Box MySQL settings. The original `app.php` is renamed to `app.php.original`.

A folder `public` is created with a new CakePHP project.

Open <http:192.168.33.10/> in your browser to check if things work.
